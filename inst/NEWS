Version 0.7-1

- Upgraded included SQLite from 3.6.0 to 3.6.4

- Old news is now in ONEWS.  Taking a fresh start with this NEWS file
  to keep better track of changes on a per-release basis.

- Added a HACKING file where we will add notes about how to do
  development on RSQLite.

Sparse notes from previous releases is available in ONEWS.  The best

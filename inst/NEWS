version 0.2-1

* worked mostly in the configuration;  added the --enable-sqlite and
  --with-sqlite arguments to have the RSQLite configuration also install 
  SQLite or locate it, respectively.

version 0.1-1

* first implementation -- use the RS-DBI.[ch] code (which is the core
  connection/cursor manager) "as is" and modified the RS-MySQL.[hc], 
  (which sits directly on top of the MySQL C API) and replace the 
  MySQL API calls with SQLite API calls.  This was pretty easy, except 
  for the fact that the SQLite API is so miminal (3, yes, 3 C functions) 
  with no support for connections, result set (cursors), data types, 
  meta-data -- nothing.  So I had to simulate all this. (Actually it 
  wasn't too bad).

Version 0.3-2

* Ported to Windows.  It now installs fine under Windows with 

    Rcmd INSTALL RSQLite_0.3-2.tar.gz

  (there's also a binary RSQLite_0.3-2.zip)

* Added code to verify that the SQLite library versions used for 
  compilation and at runtime agree.

* Added source sqlite-2.8.3.

* Fixed minor documentation errors and removed the DBI.pdf documentation
  file, which is included in the required DBI package.

* The package now installs as a binary image by default (use the --no-save
  argument to R CMD INSTALL to override this).

Version 0.3-1

* Moved the implementation to version 4 style classes, and it now
  it is fully compliant with the DBI 0.1-3.  

* Simplified the core helper R/SQLite functions (w. prefix "sqlite")
  following the ROracle model.

* Updated to sqlite version 2.7.1 (note that if you have an sqlite
  database file from a version prior to 2.6 you'll need to update
  it -- for details see http://www.hwaic.com/sw/sqlite).

Version 0.2-1

* Worked mostly in the configuration;  added the --enable-sqlite and
  --with-sqlite arguments to have the RSQLite configuration also install 
  SQLite or locate it, respectively.

Version 0.1-1

* First implementation -- used the RS-DBI.[ch] code (which is the core
  connection/cursor manager) "as is" and modified the RS-MySQL.[hc], 
  (which sits directly on top of the MySQL C API) and replace the 
  MySQL API calls with SQLite API calls.  This was pretty easy, except 
  for the fact that the SQLite API is so minimal (3, yes, 3 C functions) 
  with no support for connections, result set (cursors), data types, 
  meta-data -- nothing.  So I had to simulate all this. (Actually it 
  wasn't too bad).

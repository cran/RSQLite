RSQLite -- An embedded database engine in R

SQLite (http://www.sqlite.org) is a public-domain,
single-user, very light-weight database engine that implements
a decent subset of the SQL 92 standard, including the core
table creation, updating, insertion, and selection operations,
plus transaction management.

RSQLite requires SQLite version 2.8.6, and it's included
as part of this package.

For those interested, the actual implementation of SQLite
relies on a simple virtual database machine for dynamically
translating SQL into executable code, for details see
www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/vdbe.html

RSQLite complies with the R/S database interface being defined
by the R-SIG-DB group.

See the file "INSTALL" for details on how to install the package on
Linux/Unix-like systems.  See INSTALL.windows for instructions on
how to compile it from source, but notice that there is a Windows
binary distribution.

RSQLite -- An embedded database engine in R

SQLite (http://www.sqlite.org) is a public-domain,
single-user, very light-weight database engine that implements
a decent subset of the SQL 92 standard, including the core
table creation, updating, insertion, and selection operations,
plus transaction management.

For those interested, the actual implementation of SQLite
relies on a simple virtual database machine for dynamically
translating SQL into executable code, for details see
www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/vdbe.html

RSQLite complies with DBI database interface.

See the file "INSTALL" for details on how to install the package on
Linux/Unix-like systems.  See INSTALL.windows for instructions on
how to compile it from source, but notice that there is a Windows
binary distribution.

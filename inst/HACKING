* Updating the included SQLite version

1. Download the sqlite-amalgamatation from
   http://www.sqlite.org/download.html.  Unzip files to
   RSQLite/src/sqlite.

2. Change the version in the DESCRIPTION file.
* Uploading to CRAN
Here's a curl command example for uploading new versions of packages:

  curl --disable-epsv -T DBI_1.2.3.tar.gz ftp://cran.R-project.org/incoming/

Then send email to: cran@r-project.org

* Running the RUnit unit tests

  cd RSQLite/inst/UnitTests
  make

If you have already installed the version you want to test, then you
can run "make test" instead which skips the installation step.

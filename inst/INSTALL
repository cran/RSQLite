RSQLite -- Embedding the SQLite engine in R

(The RSQLite package includes a recent copy of the SQLite 
distribution from http://www.sqlite.org.)

Installation
------------

There are 3 alternatives for installation:

1. Simple installation:  

      R CMD INSTALL RSQLite-<version>.tar.gz

   the installation automatically detects whether SQLite is 
   available in any of your system directories;  if it's not 
   available, it installs the SQLite engine and the R-SQLite 
   interface under the package directory $R_PACKAGE_DIR/sqlite.

2. If you have SQLite installed in a non-system directory (e.g,
   in $HOME/sqlite), 
   
   a) You can use

      export PKG_LIBS="-L$HOME/sqlite/lib -lsqlite"
      export PKG_CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/sqlite/include"
   
      R CMD INSTALL RSQLite-<version>.tar.gz

   b) or you can use the --with-sqlite-dir configuration argument

      R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=--with-sqlite-dir=$HOME/sqlite \
                    RSQLite-<version>.tar.gz

3. If you don't have SQLite but you rather install the version we provide
   into a directory different than the RSQLite package, for instance,
   $HOME/app/sqlite, use

      R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=--enable-sqlite=$HOME/app/sqlite \
                    RSQLite-<version>.tar.gz

Usage
-----

Note that if you use an *existing* SQLite library that resides in a 
non-system directory (e.g., other than /lib, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib) 
you may need to include it in our LD_LIBRARY_PATH, prior to invoking R.  
For instance

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/sqlite/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
    R
    > library(help=RSQLite)
    > library(RSQLite)

(if you use the --enable-sqlite=DIR configuration argument, the SQLite 
library is statically linked to the RSQLite R package, and you need 
not worry about setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.)

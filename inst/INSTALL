RSQLite -- Embedding the SQLite engine in R

(The RSQLite package includes a copy of the SQLite 2.0.5
 distribution from www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite.)

Installation
------------

There are 3 alternatives for installation:

1. Simple installation:  

      R CMD INSTALL RSQLite-<version>.tar.gz

   the installation automatically detects whether SQLite is available
   in your system;  if it's not available, it installs the SQLite engine
   and the R-SQLite interface under the package.

2. If you have SQLite installed in a non-system directory (e.g, in
   $HOME/sqlite), use

     export PKG_LIBS="-L$HOME/sqlite/lib -lsqlite"
     export PKG_CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/sqlite/include"
   
     R CMD INSTALL RSQLite-<version>.tar.gz

3. Finally, if you don't have SQLite but you rather install it into
   directory different than the RSQLite package (for instance,
   $HOME/app/sqlite, use

     R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=--enable-sqlite=$HOME/app/sqlite \
               RSQLite-<version>.tar.gz

Usage
-----

Note that if the SQLite library is in a non-system directory (e.g.,
other than /lib, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib) you may need to include
it in our LD_LIBRARY_PATH, prior to invoking R.  For instance

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/sqlite/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
    R
    > library(help=RSQLite)
    > library(RSQLite)

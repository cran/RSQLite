Version 0.4-1 of the RSQLite package has been uploaded to CRAN
(RSQLite embeds the SQLite (www.sqlite.org) database engine in R.)

Changes include:

* Fixed problems exporting/importing NA's 

* An experimental new dbWriteTable() method to create SQLite tables
  from simple files (delimited fields) without creating intermediate 
  data.frames (useful for handling reasonably large amounts of data), 
  e.g., 
     > dbWriteTable(con, "tablename", "filename", header = TRUE, 
     +              sep = ",", eol = "\n", skip = 0)
     > methods?dbWriteTable           ## see full documentation
  
* dbConnect() now accepts values for the "cache_size" and "synchronous" 
  PRAGMAs (synchronous is set to 0 or "off") to improve SQLite 
  performance.

Thanks to Seth Falcon, Ronggui Huang, and Charles Loboz for their
patches, bug reports, suggestions, and testing.

RSQLite RUnit unit tests
========================

This directory contains RUnit unit tests for RSQLite.  Test files
match the glob "*_test.R".

Running the tests
-----------------

You can run all tests by checking the package using R CMD check.  This
will run the unit tests by executing the test script in
RSQLite/tests/RSQLite_unit_tests.R.  A test failure or error will
cause check to fail.

You can also run the tests from an R session by calling the
non-exported function RSQLite:::.test_RSQLite().  You can optionally
pass a directory argument which should be an absolute path to the unit
tests.  R's working directory will be set to this directory before
running the tests so that test code can use relative paths to refer to
data files.  If not specified, the directory used is the UnitTests
directory of the installed RSQLite package.

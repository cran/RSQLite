SQLite Version 2.8.6, dated 2003/06/04.

The files "sqlite.def" and "sqlite.dll" in the zip archive "RSQLite-win.zip"
provide the Windows SQLite C library, they were copied from
    http://www.hwcia.com/sw/sqlite/sqlitedll.zip 

The file "libsqlite.a" (also in the above zip archive) was created from the 
above two files as follows:

dlltool --dllname sqlite.dll --def sqlite.def --ouput-lib libsqlite.a -k

(the -k is critical!)

Note that in src/Makevars.win we use this libsqlite.a file when we add
-lsqlite to PKG_LIBS.

The file sqlite.dll needs to be somewhere in the path, say ./libs

The header file sqlite.h needs to be extracted from the Windows
source file libs/sqlite-win32-2.8.6.zip into the "src" dir.

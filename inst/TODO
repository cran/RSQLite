* Need to do a lot more testing.  In particular the actual SQL
  engine needs vigorous testing -- I've done very simple things
  with it.

* The actual R SQLite package shares an enormous amount of code
  with both the RMySQL and ROracle drivers, so that piece should
  be somewhat stable (he says!).  On the other hand, currently
  we cannot use both drivers simulatanously (this should be an
  easy fix).
  
* Once the R-SIG-DB nails down the common database interface,
  we'll need to make RSQLite comply with it. (Shouldn't be too
  difficult.)

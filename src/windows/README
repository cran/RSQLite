Building RSQLite on Windows.

Currently we include SQLite Version =3.3.8, dated 2006/10/09
(the <version> tag is "3_3_8")

Steps:

(1) Donwload the following from http://www.sqlite.org:

      sqlitedll-<version>.zip     (precompiled Windows DLL)
      sqlite-source_<version>.zip (preprocessed C, we only need sqlite3.h)
      
(2) In src/windows, unpack the following *dll, *def and sqlite3.h files:

      unzip sqlitedll-<version>.zip    
      unzip sqlite-source_<version>.zip sqlite3.h
  
NOTES:

The "configure.win" script copies the sqlite3.dll to ../../libs, and 
also creates the "libsqlite3.a" to link against.  This is done with

dlltool --dllname sqlite3.dll --def sqlite3.def --output-lib libsqlite3.a -k

(the -k is critical!)

Note that in src/Makevars.win we use this libsqlite3.a file when we 
add -lsqlite3 to PKG_LIBS.
